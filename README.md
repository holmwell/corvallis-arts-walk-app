# corvallis-arts-walk-app

The Corvallis Arts Walk is a community event that occurs every third Thursday
in Corvallis, Oregon. The event consists of destinations -- typically studios
or art galleries -- that feature local artists and their art.

This app provides a list and a map of arts walk destinations. It is available
in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holmwell.corvallis_arts_walk&hl=en)
and the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/corvallis-arts-walk/id1028923377?mt=8).

The app gets its data from [corvallis-arts-walk-assets](https://github.com/holmwell/corvallis-arts-walk-assets), 
and requires an internet connection to get the latest data.
