  		<p>CAW is a grass-roots organized art walk that takes place on the 3rd Thursday of each month in downtown Corvallis. Galleries, studios, arts/crafts stores and the occasional pop-up keep their doors open late to host an art-related event or demonstration. The walk occurs from 4 to 8&nbsp;p.m.</p>

  		<p>The CAW is supported by our generous sponsors:</p>
